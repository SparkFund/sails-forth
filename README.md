# sails-forth

Sails-forth is a clojure salesforce library. It is specified with clojure.spec.
It uses a stateful client object to transparently handle authentication and
version detection.

## Installation

`sparkfund/sails-forth 0.10.1`

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[sails-forth.client :as sf])

(def config
  {:username "..."
   :password "..."
   :token "..."
   :consumer-key "..."
   :consumer-secret "..."
   :sandbox? false})

(def client (sf/build-http-client config))

(sf/limits! client {})

(def object-id
  (sf/create! client "contact" {:first_name "Spark" :last_name "Fund"}))

(sf/update! client "contact object-id {:last_name "Fondue"})

(sf/delete! client "contact" object-id)

(sf/query! client "select First_Name, Last_Name from contact__c")
```

A higher-level query ns leverages the salesforce schema to denote types
and fields using more idiomatically clojure keywords. It also uses the
field types to coerce values. Numbers will always be interpreted from the
json payload as bigdecimals. Fixed point numbers with zero precision will
become longs if possible, bigintegers otherwise. Ints will become longs.
Dates and datetimes will become joda localdates and dates, respectively.

```clojure
(require '[sails-forth.query as sq])

(sq/query client {:find [:contact :id :first-name :last-name]})
(sq/query client {:find [:contact :id :first-name :last-name [:faction :id :name]]})
(sq/query client {:find [:contact :id :first-name :last-name]
                  :where [[:= [:contract :last-name] "Organa"]]})
```

There is a memory client that operates on a schema and provides working impls of
all of the client fns. The query fn is limited to a subset of the soql operators,
including =, AND, OR, and IN, though adding support for more operators is very
straightforward.

``` clojure
(def mc (sf/build-memory-client (sf/schema client #{:contact})))
```

There is support for building transactions which can be applied to datomic
to record observations from salesforce queries:

``` clojure
(require '[sails-forth.datomic :as sd])

(def txns
  (sd/assert-query client "sf" {:find [:opportunity :id :name [:customer :id :name]]}))
```
